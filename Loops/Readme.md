#Loops in java
-------------------
=>while loop
while(#condition){
    //code
}

whenever condition is true it will do what code will say it is an infenite loop

#for loop
for(initialisation; condition; updation){
    //do something
}

#remember logic
if we want last digit of the number then simply find mod of number with 10

if we want to remove it then divide it with 10

#break       to move out from the loop we use it
