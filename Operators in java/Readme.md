Operators

symbol that tell compiler to perform some operation

operator:- some action like -,+ ,*...
operand->a,b,..


#Types of operators

    Arithmetic op(unary and binary)
    Relational op
    Logical op
    Bitwise op
    Assignment op

#Arithmetic ops

=>Binay when there is a need of two or more operators
        +
        -
        *
        /
        %(modulo calculate remainder)

=>Unary single operand is needed
++(increement op) a=a+1
        |-preincrement ++a 
                in this first value change then vlue use 
        |-post increment a++
                first istemal then increment
--(decreament op) a=a-1

#relational operators
-------------------------
 == equal equal to it check if the two values are  same or not

 != is oposit of ==
 >,<,>=,<= these are also used in java as same as other language like c c++ and py


 #Logical op
 --------------------------
 
 && logicl and
 || logical or
 ! logical not


#Assignment op
---------------------------
    =
    += is a short of a=a+xomething can be qrien as a+=10
    -= is a short of a=a-something can be writen as a-=10
    same /= and %= are available


#ternery op
---------------------------
var = condition ? statement1(if cond is true then state1):statement2(if cond is fail then state2);
